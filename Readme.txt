1. Exploring the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana 2023.
- Welcome to my analysis of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) for 2023! This is the initiative by the Government of India for affordable housing for every citizen.

2. Why PMAY Matters:
- "Envisioning Housing for All by 2022" was the main aim of PMAY. The scheme is not just about constructing buildings but about creating spaces where even the economically weaker sections, low-income groups, and middle-income families can thrive. This initiative spans both urban and rural areas, ensuring that no one is left behind.

3. My Mission in Exploratory Data Analysis:
As I dive into the data for 2023, our goal is simple: to understand how well PMAY is reaching the people it aims to serve.

4. What I am Looking Into:
A. Regional Stories:
-  I am exploring how different states are experiencing the PMAY scheme.

B. People and Diversity:
- I am looking in on how different groups, like minorities, scheduled castes, tribes, and others, are experiencing the impact.

C. The Waiting Game:
-  I have tried to check on communities who are on the waiting list. Understanding the backlog helps us spot areas where things might need a   little nudge, ensuring that benefits reach those who need them.

D. Minority Impact:
-  How well is PMAY doing in minority communities? I am assessing the extent to which they've embraced the benefits, and I have looked for areas where a bit more outreach and support could make a big difference.

E. Why It Matters:
-  My analysis isn't just numbers and charts. It's a guide for the decision-makersâ€”policymakers, government bodies, and anyone involved in making PMAY scheme work.
